U need to set up your computer to run this program.

The program was devleoped at ubuntu 64-bit system.

There are command lines to install neccessary modules for ubuntu below.

u can just execute the setup.sh which contains all command lines below by
command line: ./setup.sh
	if it doesn't work, try to set execute permission for setup by 
	command line : chmod 755 setup.sh
	and then try again ./setup.sh

# install numpy at your ubuntu.
command line:
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy


# install tkinter. I seperated the main module and gui part so u can use another proper gui module u want.
command line:
sudo apt-get install python python-tk idle python-pmw python-imaging


# install visual python. if u go to "http://vpython.org/" and do what they say, it will be very annoying and even u don't need to do that for installing visual. at the homepage they say that u need to install the visual as a exe file by wine.

if u use linux, just install visual python by
command line:
sudo apt-get install python-visual
sudo apt-get install libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev
